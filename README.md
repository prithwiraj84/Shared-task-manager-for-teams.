# NFT Art Marketplace

## Project Description
Create a platform to buy, sell, and auction digital art as NFTs. This marketplace enables artists to mint NFTs representing their digital artwork, which can then be listed for sale, purchased by collectors, and traded securely on the blockchain.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to build a decentralized and transparent NFT marketplace that empowers artists and creators by providing them with a secure platform to monetize their work without intermediaries. We aim to enhance accessibility, ownership verification, and fair value distribution in the digital art industry.

## Future Scope
- **Auction System**: Introduce an auction mechanism where users can place bids on NFTs.
- **Royalties for Creators**: Implement a system where artists receive a percentage of resale profits.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Expand the marketplace to support multiple blockchain networks.
- **Fractional Ownership**: Enable shared ownership of high-value NFTs.
- **Social Features**: Integrate artist profiles, follower systems, and interactive engagement tools.

## Key Features
- **Minting NFTs**: Artists can create and list NFTs with metadata and pricing.
- **Buying & Selling**: Users can purchase NFTs directly from the marketplace.
- **Listing & Unlisting**: Owners can list or remove their NFTs from sale.
- **Decentralized Ownership**: Full transparency of transactions and ownership history.
- **Secure Transactions**: Smart contract ensures fair and trustless exchanges.
